# Complex Mixed Content

This document combines **multiple** formatting types in *realistic* scenarios.

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a sync tool that handles:

1. **Apple Notes export** via Swift bridge
2. **Markdown conversion** for Supernote
3. **Bidirectional sync** with conflict resolution

> Note: This is currently in development. See https://github.com/example/repo for updates.

### Key Features

- Real-time sync with `--watch` flag
- Support for **nested folders** and *special characters*
- Automatic conflict resolution (Apple wins)

### Code Example

```python
def sync_notes(direction: str = "forward"):
    """
    Sync notes between Apple Notes and Supernote.

    Args:
        direction: "forward", "reverse", or "bidirectional"
    """
    if direction == "bidirectional":
        run_reverse_sync()
        run_forward_sync()
```

## Technical Details

The architecture uses:

1. **Swift Bridge**
   - ScriptingBridge API access
   - JSON export format
   - Handles all note types

2. **Python Orchestrator**
   - Click-based CLI
   - SQLite state tracking
   - Multiple generators

Visit [our docs](https://example.com/docs) for the full API reference.

### Edge Cases Handled

| Scenario | Status |
|----------|--------|
| UTF-8 BOM | ✅ Fixed |
| Loop detection | ✅ Fixed |
| Title loss | ✅ Fixed |

## Conclusion

This mixed content tests **bold**, *italic*, `code`, links like https://example.com, and various block elements together.
