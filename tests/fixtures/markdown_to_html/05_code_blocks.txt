# Code Blocks

## Simple Code Block

```
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Code Block With Language

```python
def greet(name):
    """Greet someone by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
```

## Code Block With Special Characters

```html
<div class="container">
    <h1>Title & Subtitle</h1>
    <p>Text with <em>emphasis</em></p>
</div>
```

## Code After Text

Some explanation text here.

```javascript
const x = 42;
const y = "test";
```

More text after code.

## Inline vs Block

Use `inline code` for short snippets.

For longer code:

```
multi
line
code
block
```

## Empty Lines In Code

```
line one

line three after empty

line five
```
