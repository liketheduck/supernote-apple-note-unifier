# Basic Formatting Test

This tests **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic combined***.

Also testing __underline bold__ and _underline italic_ styles.

Here's some `inline code` in a sentence.

And ~~strikethrough text~~ for deleted content.

Multiple **bold words in a row** and *italic words in a row* work fine.

Edge case: *star at start* and *star at end*

Edge case: text*with*stars*inside should not italicize.

Edge case: **nested *formatting* works** too.
